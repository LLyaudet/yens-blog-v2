There's a subtle bug that happens when you're using Gboard (the default Google keyboard) on Android on certain websites. Watch what happens after I type "test" into the Guardian crossword app ([Link](https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/29529)), and try to delete the word:

In case you missed it, **after typing T-E-S-T, I have to press `Backspace` 4 times before letters start getting deleted.**

This isn't limited to the Guardian crossword. This also happens in the Typescript playground:

But this does not happen everywhere. Here it is working as expected in a plain HTML input field:

And to be clear, this does not happen with iOS keyboards, or with Gboard on iOS. This appears to be specific to the Android Gboard.

## The bug

This bug is related to the way keypress events are generated by keyboards. 
This was first reported [here](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/273456899).
